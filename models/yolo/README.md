# YOLO Models for Security Detection

This directory contains YOLO-based object detection models for security monitoring.

## Models

- `yolov8n.pt` - YOLOv8 Nano (lightweight, fast)
- `yolov8s.pt` - YOLOv8 Small (balanced)
- `yolov8m.pt` - YOLOv8 Medium (higher accuracy)

## Usage

Models are automatically loaded by the ML detector node.

## Training

Custom models can be trained on security-specific datasets.
