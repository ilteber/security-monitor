# Hazard Monitor for ROS2

A real-time hazard detection and monitoring system for autonomous vehicles using ROS2.

## Overview

This project aims to develop a comprehensive hazard monitoring system that can detect various types of hazards in autonomous driving scenarios, including:

- Perception hazards (sensor failures, object detection issues)
- Localization hazards (GPS loss, SLAM drift)
- Planning hazards (collision risk, path planning failures)
- System health monitoring
- Environmental hazards

## Goals

- Real-time hazard detection and classification
- Multi-sensor fusion (Camera, LiDAR, IMU, GPS)
- Integration with CARLA and Gazebo simulators
- ROS2-based modular architecture
- Machine learning models for hazard prediction

## Status

ðŸš§ **Project in early development phase**

Currently planning the system architecture and initial implementation approach.
