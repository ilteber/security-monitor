# Security Monitor for ROS2

A real-time security monitoring system for autonomous vehicles using ROS2.

## Overview

This project aims to develop a comprehensive security monitoring system that can detect various types of security threats in autonomous driving scenarios, including:

- Perception security threats (sensor failures, object detection issues)
- Localization security threats (GPS loss, SLAM drift)
- Planning security threats (collision risk, path planning failures)
- System health monitoring
- Environmental security threats

## Goals

- Real-time security threat detection and classification
- Multi-sensor fusion (Camera, LiDAR, IMU, GPS)
- Integration with CARLA and Gazebo simulators
- ROS2-based modular architecture
- Machine learning models for security threat prediction

## Status

ðŸš§ **Project in early development phase**

Currently planning the system architecture and initial implementation approach.
